Line and Width Selection Help
=============================

Boxing allows you to restrict the comparison to specific line numbers or column
widths. This is useful for comparing sub-components of files.

Syntax
------

The selection syntax supports both explicit file targeting (a/b) and positional
arguments.

Format: [a:]start[-end],[b:]start[-end],...

Examples:
  1-8,2-9           Line 1 to 8 of file A, Line 2 to 9 of file B
  a:1-8,b:2-9       Same as above (explicit)
  1-8               Line 1 to 8 of both files (if only one range provided)
  a:10              Line 10 of file A only (no range for B?)

Flags
-----

  --lines, -l       Select specific lines to compare.
                    Example: diff compare -l 1-5,10-15 file1 file2

  --width, -w       Select specific columns (width) to compare.
                    Example: diff compare -w 1-80 file1 file2

Limits
------

  --max-lines       Limit the total number of lines compared (truncates input).
  --max-width       Limit the width of lines compared (truncates lines).
  --search-depth    Max lines to search for alignment (previously --max-lines).
